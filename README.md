# ðŸš— Vehicle Chatbot using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements a **Vehicle Chatbot** that leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide accurate, context-aware answers based on automotive manuals, technical documents, and FAQs. The chatbot retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base and combines it with generative AI to ensure factual and coherent responses.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Build an intelligent assistant to answer vehicle-related queries.
- Combine the strengths of retrieval (precision) and generation (fluency).
- Support mechanics, car owners, and service agents with instant documentation access.

## ðŸ§  Key Components

- **Document Ingestion:** Upload and parse PDF, text, or HTML-based vehicle manuals.
- **Embedding & Indexing:** Use embedding models to vectorize chunks and store in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone).
- **Retrieval:** Find relevant document chunks based on user queries.
- **Generation:** Use an LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT, HuggingFace) to answer based on retrieved content.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **LangChain** for RAG framework
- **Huggingface** for embedding
- **OpenAI** for LLMs
- **Pinecone** for vector search
- **Flask** (optional) for UI
- **PyMuPDF / pdfminer / BeautifulSoup** for document parsing

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources

- Vehicle Ownerâ€™s Manuals  
- Technical Service Documents  
- Manufacturer FAQs
